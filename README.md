- Match result recording
- Automatic winner determination
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface (CLI)
- File-based data storage

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/thelazygenius404/C-_Project.git
   cd 
   ```
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
   ```sh
   g++ -o tournamen main.cpp  -std=c++11
   ```
3. Run the executable:
